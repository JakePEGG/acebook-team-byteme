## Instructions

Run `npm install` in your terminal each time you pull or clone the repo to ensure that your local machine has the correct npm packages to run the app.

You need to setup the database url in the <i>.env </i> file to link the app to the cloud MongoDB database if you want to run your app on your own machine. As the url contains private information, it is not published in this repo.

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to run the app in a local server. The port is set to 1234, and type `http://localhost:1234/` in your server.
